# Team-Profile Generator
This Team-Profile Generator was created to provide teams with a way to easily generate a list of their members that includes relavant data for each member. 

This makes it possible for teams to save time that would have been spent creating a profile, and spend more time working on their projects. 

This project was a valuable learning experience in OOP, and Jest unit-testing.
